# Learning to Learn

## Two modes of brain

1. the brain works in two modes

   - focused
   - diffuse

2. different areas are activated in two modes

3. introduction of procastination

   - areas relating to pain is active when you're rather not willing to do something

   - the brain tends to do more pleasant tasks, and you get temporal happiness

   - but this discomfort disappear soon after you start on it

   - use pomodoro to fight against procastination

     <div style="width:50%;">  
       <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stevring/Pics/main/pomodoro.png" style="width: 100%" />
     	<div style="text-align:center; font-size:12px">
         pomodoro: no interruptions in 25 minutes, and give yourself rewards when finished.
       </div>
     </div>

4. practise makes permanent

   - the more abstract, the more practise is required to build neuron connections
   - after intensed focusing, take a break to let your brain consolidate what' you have learned

5. two types of memory

   - working memory
     - deals with immediately and consciously processing
     - centered at prefontal cortex
     - holds about for trunks

   - long term memory

     - like a storage, can store billions of items
     - it takes time and practise to move information from working memory to long term memory

   - spaced repetition

     - 20 times of repetition is not as efficient as one time in 20 days

         <div>
             <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stevring/Pics/main/spaced_repetition.png" style="width: 100%" />
             <div style="text-align:center; font-size:12px">
               spaced repetition: repeat in spaced days is more efficient
             </div>
         </div>

6. the importance of sleeping

   - being awake creates toxic substance and sleep washes this substances out
   - revise what has been learned before sleep helps memory it
   - enhance understanding of concepts

## Chunks

1. What is a chunk
   - a compressed package of memory inherently connected
   - chunking makes the brain works efficiently
2. How to form a chunk
   - fully focused attention on the information you want to chunk
   - understand it, do it yourself
   - getting context: how and when to use this chunk
   - practise makes the chunks firm and accessible
3.  the importance of recall
   - recall: read the material and recall it without the book
   - do recall in a different place helps you understand it
   - recall is more efficient than re-reading
4. illusions of Competence, 
   - do exercise yourself. the solution manual is not yours.

5. mini-testing, and making mistakes is a good way to recall
6. overlearning
7. deliberate practise
   - focus more on the part you feel difficult
8. einstellung
   - previously formed chunks may prevent a better idea or solution
   - interleaving helps solve it by learning different concepts in an alternate way

## Procastination and Memory

1. understand the habit of procastination

   - when first doing something, it might be very difficult because of the immense information coming to you. but when chunks are formed, things become easier because you only need to focus on the main part.
   - four parts of habit
     - the cue. the signal triggers your action.
     - the routine. the action you take when you see the signal
     - the reward. either temporal or long-term, such as happiness, money..
     - the belief.
2. to stop procastination, focus on the process rather than the result.
3. harnessing your zombies to help you

   - Identify the cue that launches you into the zombie mode
     - usually four types of cues: location, time, how you feel, reactions
- make a plan to form a new routine
     - leave phone in another place
     - turn off the computer
   - find a reward for your successful fight against procastination.
   - encurage yourself that you can work through it.
4. juggling life and learning
   - Keep weekly list of key tasks
   - Writedown a daily "to do" list in the evening
   - knowing how much time you need to finish a job is a crucial ability
   - Lady luck favors the one who tries
